    <h3>Community and Support</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Developers are encouraged to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gophercloud-dev">join our mailing list.</a></li>
      <li>Users who do not wish to contribute directly to Gophercloud may give feedback by clicking on <a href="https://github.com/rackspace/gophercloud/issues">Issues</a> and opening a bug or feature request ticket on Github.</li>
      <li>For more personal interaction, we currently hang out on the #openstack-sdks channel on Freenode IRC (<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openstack-sdks">web access link</a>).</li>

    <h3>Contributing to Gophercloud</h3>
    <p>Would you like to contribute a feature, API, or bug fix to Gophercloud?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure a ticket for it exists on our <a href="https://github.com/rackspace/gophercloud/issues">Github issues page.</a>  Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.</li>
      <li>It's not strictly required, but we really recommend discussing your concerns and design to solve the problem with a Gophercloud developer.  Many issues concerning Gophercloud are known (particularly missing bindings!), or possible solutions might be better expressed using a different implementation or algorithm.  This can avoid delays in code review later.</li>
      <li>Fork the package and code, test, and document!  Please try to follow general Go community guidelines when writing new code or maintaining existing code.  Please try to document new functions, types, or packages.  Be sure to adjust the godocs for any existing functions you've modified (if appropriate).</li>
      <li>Submit a pull request!  We'll review the code and give feedback.  Make sure to include as many tests as appropriate.  Where inappropriate, be sure to document why, somewhere, either in the code or in the git commit log.</li>
      <li>And speaking of Git commit logs, be sure to reference the Github issues ticket in the git commit log message as well, as a courtesy to other developers.  That will also help us to create changelogs in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you follow these steps, you should have no problems getting code committed into Gophercloud!</p>
